# What is node?
---
## Not just server-side JavaScript.
- ### A V8 engine with I/O apis
- ### Non-blocking, event driven at its core
  Not because of JavaScript. JavaScript was chosen because of this conscious design decision
- ### General purpose & web ready
  HTTP and its needs are first class citizens in the API
- ### It's not fairy dust and kittens
  It's just another tool

## Why the hate?

- ### JavaScript has a sordid history
  Shims, IE6, Performance, Spaghetti code
- ### node.js is single threaded
  When everything is going multi core, why go backwards?
- ### Callbacks are disgusting
  They can be, but you can write crappy code anywhere...
- ### It's different
  You can't jump into node and start coding the way you always have

> “If you look at Rails and Node on GitHub and compare the traffic,” says Hughes-Croucher, “Rails had 270,000 views over the past three months. Node has 325,000, and it’s only going up… it’s exploding.”

## "ruby on rails" vs "node.js"

####.center This is absolutely not a competition with rails.

####.center This is an example of something with historically massive popularity<br>vs something new in a similar arena.

# Who cares if it's popular?
---
# You should
---
# Your boss should
---
# Your company should
---
# Popularity means growth

# Growth means support

# Support means longevity
---
# node.js is a unique addition to your toolbox that won't go away
