> The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers. Making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.<br><br>
> Built on Connect you can use only what you need, and nothing more, applications can be as big or as small as you like, even a single file. Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine
